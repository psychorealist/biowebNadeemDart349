    <p>Art is a form of expression, and when asked about his creative process that is so unique to every artist, Nadeem said it was about jotting things down that came to him in the moment “I make my art in the moment and don’t like to plan out too long”. A simple writing down of an idea that comes to mind and a reflection later on is the artist’s preferred way of making magic. When he has the time, he starts to work on canvas and while working, he starts to build upon it. The artist also added that “some things just come to you as you work.”</p>
    <p>When asked about what role he believes artists have in society, Nadeem does not hesitate to say artists are the “spices of society” and the key is “being as original as possible by expressing yourself”. A constantly evolving subject, art is to be enjoyed visually, but impeccable pieces stimulate the mind as well. When dissecting Nadeem’s art we can’t help but notice that the surrealistic pieces might have a deeper meaning</p>
